## Instructions
Copy contents of `release/otls` to any of your otl locations: for example, your houdini user folder: `/home/username/houdiniXX.Y/otls` (Linux) `C:\Users\username\Documents\houdiniXX.Y\otls` (Windows) folder (create `otls` subfolder if it doesn't exist) and you are good to go! (XX.Y will be your houdini version number, like 17.0 or 17.5)
**Examples** available in `release` folder
